1) How many pennies could you put on the Golden Gate Bridge without any of them overlapping? For this question, please write out each step in your thought process.

Step 1: Find the surface area of the Golden Gate Bridge. 

	To do this, I researched and found the length and width of the bridge and multiplied the two measurements to find the area.

	Length of Bridge: 8,981 ft = 107,772 in
	Width of Bridge:     90 ft = 1080 in
	Area of Bridge:   Length x Width = 107,772 x 1080 = 116,393,760 square inches

Step 2: Treate each penny as a "square". Find each penny's surface area.

	Since the pennies will be placed next to each other, there will be an empty space in between each penny. Therefore, each penny can be treated as a square and its area can be found by finding the diameter of a penny (length and width of square).

	Diameter of penny: 0.750 in = Length of "square" = Width of "square"
	Area of penny:     Length x Width = 0.750 x 0.750 = 0.5625 square inches

Step 3: Divide the area of the Bridge by the area of each penny.

	Dividing the surface area of the bridge by that of each penny will reveal the number of pennies that could be placed on the bridge without any overlapping.

	Number of Pennies: Area of Bridge / Area of each penny = 116,393,760 / 0.5625 = 206,922,240 pennies


Therefore, you could put 206,922,240 pennies on the Golden Gate Bridge without having any of them overlapp.
